> A Nuxt.js setup to generate an intuitive, readable and collaborative API documentation with copy and paste able examples

## The Docs

[![Storyblok Documentation setup](https://a.storyblok.com/f/39898/3356x1830/d57a561cb5/storyblok-documentation.jpg)](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/api/content-delivery)

## Why?

We at Storyblok highly value your feedback and your desire to know more about our API and possible use-cases, examples and hidden features. To support that this project allows you to run our API documentation for the content delivery and management API completely offline and contribute to it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
# and generates doc jsons
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## The Folder Structure

```
- content
  - {origin}.{lang}.json
  - {origin} (content delivery or management)
    - {lang} (en, de, ...)
      - categories
        - method/section.md
```

## How should the method/section.md look like:

```
---
title: The Sidebar Title & Headline
sidebarTitle: optional: This overrides the title
---

This is the method written content; the left area of a section.

;examplearea

This is the method example; the right area of a section.
```
